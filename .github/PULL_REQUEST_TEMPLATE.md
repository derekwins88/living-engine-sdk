# Ghost Shell Scrub PR
> Purpose: Remove sensitive anchor points, prevent future leakage, and document verification.

## What changed
- [ ] Redacted sensitive constants / ritual identifiers
- [ ] Rewrote history to eliminate leaked anchor points (if applicable)
- [ ] Added pre-commit / pre-push guardrails to prevent reintroduction
- [ ] Updated docs to reference placeholders instead of sensitive values

## Why
We are composting digital footprint artifacts that can be scraped from:
- commit history
- tags/releases
- PR diffs and code review comments
- CI logs and build artifacts

This PR enforces “Direct Sourcing” by removing public anchor points and adding forward guards.

# 1) Pull Request & Commit History Scrub (Anchor Removal)

### Target redactions
**Replace (examples):**
- Any explicit constants / thresholds (e.g., ΔΦ ≈ …)
- Specific ritual names / L-Spec ritual identifiers
- Any unique “formula phrasing” that can be searched verbatim

**With:**
- `***REMOVED***` (or repo-standard placeholder)

### History rewrite (check if done)
- [ ] Used `git-filter-repo` **or** `BFG Repo-Cleaner`
- [ ] Confirmed sensitive strings no longer exist anywhere in history

**Commands used (paste exact commands):**
```bash
# Example (choose ONE tool path)

# A) git-filter-repo (recommended)
git filter-repo --replace-text scrub_words.txt

# B) BFG (example)
bfg --replace-text scrub_words.txt --no-blob-protection

Force push (only if history rewrite occurred)
	•	Coordinated with collaborators (they must re-clone or hard-reset)
	•	Force-pushed rewritten history

git push --force --all
git push --force --tags
```

2) StewartHashBlock Logic (Waste Management / Forward Guard)

Guardrails added
	•	Pre-commit hook or CI check to detect reintroduced sensitive tokens
	•	“Entropy drift” / threshold / ethics signature checks enforced before merge
	•	Quarantine behavior defined (reject commit/PR, route to safe review)

Where it lives (paths):
	•	Hook: /.githooks/pre-commit or .pre-commit-config.yaml
	•	CI: /.github/workflows/*
	•	Filter module: /<your_path>/StewartHashBlock.*

What it blocks
	•	Any reappearance of scrubbed strings
	•	High-risk identifiers without guardrails
	•	Accidental re-posting in docs/comments/tests

3) Direct Sourcing Alignment (Process Note)

Work mode alignment
	•	Morning (Cathedral Mode): verification / compression tightening
	•	Afternoon (Archive Mode): narrative weaving / language shaping

Notes (optional):
	•	What was preserved intentionally:
	•	What was removed intentionally:
	•	What remains private by design:

⸻

Verification

Local verification
	•	git grep on working tree for removed tokens returns nothing

git grep -n "ΔΦ\\|0\\.09\\|<RITUAL_NAME>\\|<SENSITIVE_TOKEN>" || true

History verification
	•	Checked history for removed tokens (choose one)

# quick check
git log -p --all -S"0.09" -- . || true

# or search all objects (may be slow)
git rev-list --all | xargs -n 1 git grep -n "0.09" 2>/dev/null || true

Remote verification
	•	Confirmed GitHub UI search doesn’t show removed tokens
	•	Confirmed CI logs do not print sensitive tokens

⸻

Risk / Impact
	•	Risk level: Low / Medium / High
	•	Breaking change: Yes / No
	•	If history rewrite: collaborators must re-clone or reset.

⸻

Checklist
	•	No secrets in code, docs, tests, issues, PR description
	•	No sensitive tokens in commit messages
	•	No sensitive tokens in tags/releases
	•	Guardrails prevent reintroduction
